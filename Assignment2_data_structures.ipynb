Open a text editor and create a new file. For example, you can use a plain text editor like Notepad (Windows), TextEdit (Mac), or any code editor like Visual Studio Code, Atom, or Sublime Text.\n","\n","2. Write your Python code in the text editor. For example, let's say you want to create a simple script that prints \"Hello, World!\" to the console. Your code would look like this:\n","\n","```python\n","print(\"Hello, World!\")\n","```\n","\n","3. Save the file with a .py extension. Choose a meaningful name for your script, and save it with the .py extension. For example, you can save the file as `hello.py`.\n","\n","4. Open the command line or terminal on your operating system. The method for opening the command line or terminal depends on your operating system:\n","\n","   - On Windows: Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter.\n","   - On macOS: Press `Cmd + Space`, type `terminal`, and press Enter.\n","   - On Linux: Press `Ctrl + Alt + T`.\n","\n","5. Navigate to the directory where you saved the Python script using the `cd` command. For example, if you saved the script in the Documents folder, you would use the following command:\n","\n","   ```\n","   cd Documents\n","   ```\n","\n","6. Execute the Python script by running the `python` command followed by the script's filename. For example, if your script is named `hello.py`, you would use the following command:\n","\n","   ```\n","   python hello.py\n","  ```"],"metadata":{"id":"Ep5e95ysBMTf"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Question 5\n","\n","my_list = [1,2,3,4,5]\n","sub_list = my_list[1:3]\n","print(sub_list)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"nPy1JCaUDXqR","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1688963481879,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":15,"user":{"displayName":"Riya Dhanduke","userId":"17839490895156095209"}},"outputId":"53e71273-a083-4760-bdaf-8cc17565be68"},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["[2, 3]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Question 6\n","\n","Complex number in mathematics is a number that can be expressed in the form \"a + bi,\" where \"a\" and \"b\" are real numbers, and \"i\" is the imaginary unit defined by the property that its square is equal to -1 (i^2 = -1).
