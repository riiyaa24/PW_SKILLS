    "To calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the amount of time students spend studying for an exam and their final exam scores, you would typically follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Collect Data: Gather data on the amount of time spent studying (in hours) and the corresponding final exam scores for a sample of students.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Calculate Means: Compute the mean (average) of the study time and final exam scores.\n",
