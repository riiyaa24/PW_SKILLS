    "Q1. Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python that provides tools and libraries to build web applications quickly and efficiently. It is designed to be simple, easy to use, and scalable, making it a popular choice for developing a wide range of web applications, from simple prototypes to complex web services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Flask Framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simplicity:** Flask is known for its simplicity and minimalistic design. It provides a clean and intuitive API that makes it easy for developers to get started and build web applications with minimal boilerplate code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Flexibility:** Flask is highly flexible and allows developers to customize and extend its functionality as needed. It follows a modular design, allowing developers to choose and integrate only the components they need for their specific requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Lightweight:** Flask is lightweight and has few dependencies, making it easy to install and deploy. It has a small codebase and does not impose unnecessary overhead on applications, resulting in faster performance and reduced resource usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Scalability:** Flask is scalable and can be used to build applications of any size, from small prototypes to large-scale web services. It provides support for modular design patterns, allowing developers to organize and structure their codebase effectively as their application grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Extensibility:** Flask offers a wide range of extensions and libraries that extend its functionality and provide additional features, such as authentication, database integration, form validation, and more. These extensions can be easily integrated into Flask applications to add new capabilities without reinventing the wheel.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Built-in Development Server:** Flask comes with a built-in development server that makes it easy to run and test applications locally during the development process. This development server is lightweight and easy to use, providing developers with a convenient environment for rapid prototyping and debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Community and Ecosystem:** Flask has a vibrant and active community of developers who contribute plugins, extensions, and documentation to the Flask ecosystem. This rich ecosystem of third-party tools and libraries enhances the functionality and usability of Flask and provides developers with valuable resources and support."

    "Q3. In Flask, app routing refers to the process of mapping URL paths to view functions, allowing you to define how your web application responds to different HTTP requests. App routing is accomplished using the `@app.route()` decorator, which is applied to view functions to specify the URL route that triggers the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of app routing in Flask:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def index():\n",
    "    return 'Hello, World!'\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/about')\n",
    "def about():\n",
    "    return 'About Us'\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/contact')\n",

    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `@app.route('/')`, `@app.route('/about')`, and `@app.route('/contact')` decorators define routes for the `/`, `/about`, and `/contact` URL paths, respectively.\n",
    "- Each route is associated with a view function (`index()`, `about()`, and `contact()`), which is executed when the corresponding URL is accessed.\n",
    "- When a user visits the root URL `/`, the `index()` function is triggered, and it returns the \"Hello, World!\" message.\n",
    "- Similarly, accessing the `/about` and `/contact` URLs triggers the `about()` and `contact()` functions, respectively, returning different responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use app routes in Flask for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **URL Mapping**: App routes allow us to map specific URL paths to corresponding view functions, defining the behavior of our web application for different routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Modularization**: App routes help organize the codebase by separating different functionalities into distinct view functions. Each route handles a specific URL path, making the code more modular and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Flexibility**: App routes provide flexibility in defining the structure and navigation of the web application. We can easily add, modify, or remove routes to accommodate changes in requirements or add new features.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Readability**: Using app routes with descriptive route paths improves the readability of the codebase and makes it easier for developers to understand the functionality of each route.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Scalability**: App routes facilitate the scalability of the web application by allowing us to add new routes and view functions as the application grows, without affecting existing routes or functionalities."
