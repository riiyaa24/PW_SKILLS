    "In MongoDB, the `find()` method is used to query documents from a collection based on certain criteria. This method returns a cursor, which can be iterated over to retrieve the documents matching the specified query parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic Query**: You can pass a query filter as an argument to `find()` to retrieve documents that match specific criteria. The filter is a dictionary where keys represent the field names and values represent the criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Find documents where the 'age' field is equal to 30\n",
    "result = mycollection.find({\"age\": 30})\n",
    "for document in result:\n",
    "    print(document)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Projection**: You can specify which fields to include or exclude from the returned documents using the projection parameter. Pass 1 to include a field and 0 to exclude it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Find documents and include only the 'name' and 'city' fields\n",
    "result = mycollection.find({}, {\"name\": 1, \"city\": 1})\n",
    "for document in result:\n",
    "    print(document)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Limiting Results**: You can limit the number of documents returned by using the `limit()` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Find and limit the results to 2 documents\n",
    "result = mycollection.find().limit(2)\n",
    "for document in result:\n",
    "    print(document)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sorting**: You can sort the results based on one or more fields using the `sort()` method. Use 1 for ascending order and -1 for descending order:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Find and sort documents by the 'age' field in descending order\n",
    "result = mycollection.find().sort(\"age\", -1)\n",
    "for document in result:\n",
    "    print(document)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Combining Filters**: You can combine multiple criteria using logical operators like `$and`, `$or`, and `$not`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Find documents where age is greater than 25 and city is \"New York\"\n",
    "result = mycollection.find({\"$and\": [{\"age\": {\"$gt\": 25}}, {\"city\": \"New York\"}]})\n",
    "for document in result:\n",

    "Q6. The `find()` method in MongoDB is used to query documents from a collection. It allows you to specify criteria to filter the documents you want to retrieve. You can also use `find()` without any parameters to retrieve all documents in the collection. Here's how you can use the `find()` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "\n",
    "# Close the connection to MongoDB\n",

    "In this code:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We use the `find()` method to retrieve all documents from the collection and iterate over the cursor returned by it.\n",
    "- We use the `find()` method with a query parameter to retrieve documents where the \"city\" field is \"New York\".\n",
    "- We iterate over the cursor returned by `find()` to print the matching documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also pass additional parameters to the `find()` method, such as projection to specify which fields to include or exclude, and sort to specify the sorting order of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Query documents with projection and sort\n",
    "selected_documents = mycollection.find({\"city\": \"New York\"}, {\"_id\": 0, \"name\": 1}).sort(\"name\", pymongo.ASCENDING)\n",
    "for document in selected_documents:\n",

    "Q7. In MongoDB, there are several methods available to remove documents or collections from a database. These methods offer different levels of control over what data to delete and how much of it to delete.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **delete_one()**: This method is used to delete a single document that matches a specified filter. It removes the first document that matches the filter criteria. If multiple documents match the filter, only the first one encountered is deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   result = mycollection.delete_one({\"name\": \"John\"})\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **delete_many()**: This method is used to delete multiple documents that match a specified filter. It removes all documents that match the filter criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   result = mycollection.delete_many({\"age\": {\"$gte\": 30}})\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This example deletes all documents where the \"age\" field is greater than or equal to 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **drop()**: This method is used to drop an entire collection from the database. Dropping a collection removes all documents within that collection and the collection itself. It's a more drastic action compared to deleting individual documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   mycollection.drop()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This example drops the entire collection named `mycollection`.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **delete_one()** and **delete_many()** are used when you want to remove specific documents based on certain criteria. They are helpful for fine-grained control over which data to delete.\n",
    "\n",
