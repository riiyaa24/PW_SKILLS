        "In OOP, abstraction is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces. An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own but serves as a blueprint for other classes to inherit from. It may contain both abstract (without implementation) and concrete (with implementation) methods. On the other hand, an interface is a collection of abstract methods that defines a contract for classes to implement. Classes can implement multiple interfaces but can only inherit from a single abstract class."

It enables data hiding, meaning that the internal state of an object is not directly accessible from outside the class. Instead, the class provides public methods to interact with the internal state, ensuring that the object's data is accessed and modified in a controlled manner. Encapsulation enhances data security, maintainability, and prevents unintended interference with the object's state."
