    "\n",
    "The Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF) are both mathematical functions used in probability theory and statistics to describe the likelihood of different outcomes or values of a random variable. However, they are used in different contexts depending on whether the random variable is discrete or continuous.\n",

    "**Probability Mass Function (PMF):**\n",
    "The PMF is used to describe the probability distribution of a discrete random variable. It gives the probability that the random variable takes on a specific value. Mathematically, for a discrete random variable \\(X\\), the PMF is denoted as \\(P(X = x)\\), where \\(x\\) represents the possible values of \\(X\\). The PMF must satisfy two properties: non-negativity and the sum of probabilities over all possible values must equal 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Probability Density Function (PDF):**\n",
    "The PDF is used to describe the probability distribution of a continuous random variable. Unlike the PMF, the PDF does not directly give the probability of the random variable taking on a specific value, but instead gives the relative likelihood of the random variable falling within a certain range of values. Mathematically, for a continuous random variable \\(X\\), the PDF is denoted as \\(f(x)\\). The area under the curve of the PDF over any interval gives the probability that the random variable falls within that interval.\n",

    "The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a fundamental probability distribution that is widely used to model a variety of phenomena in various fields due to its mathematical properties and the Central Limit Theorem. Here are some examples of situations where the normal distribution might be used as a model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Biological Measurements**: Biological measurements such as height, weight, blood pressure, and IQ scores often follow a normal distribution within a population.\n",
    "\n",

    "3. **Statistical Inference**: In statistical inference, many hypothesis tests and confidence intervals are based on assumptions of normality. The properties of the normal distribution, such as symmetry and known probabilities for specific intervals, make it particularly useful in these contexts.\n",
