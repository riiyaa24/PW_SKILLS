    "\n",
    "Measures of dispersion, such as range, variance, and standard deviation, are used to describe the spread or variability of a dataset. They provide information about how much the individual data points in the dataset deviate from the central tendency measures (mean, median, mode). Here's how each measure is used to describe the spread of a dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Range:\n",
    "   - Range is the simplest measure of dispersion and represents the difference between the highest and lowest values in a dataset.\n",
    "   - It provides a quick indication of the spread of the data, but it is sensitive to extreme values and may not accurately reflect the overall variability.\n",
    "   - Example: \n",
    "     Consider two datasets:\n",
    "     Dataset 1: [10, 15, 20, 25, 30] \n",
    "     Dataset 2: [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]\n",
    "     Both datasets have the same range of 25 (30 - 5), indicating that the spread of the data is the same, despite differences in the central tendency.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Variance:\n",
    "   - Variance measures the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean of the dataset.\n",
    "   - It provides a more comprehensive measure of variability, taking into account the magnitude of deviations from the mean.\n",
    "   - Example: \n",
    "     Consider a dataset of test scores: [70, 75, 80, 85, 90]\n",
    "     The mean of the dataset is 80. The deviations from the mean are (-10, -5, 0, 5, 10), and squaring these deviations gives (100, 25, 0, 25, 100).\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Standard Deviation:\n",
    "   - Standard deviation is the square root of the variance and measures the average deviation of each data point from the mean.\n",

    "   - It is also known as right skewness because the tail of the distribution points towards the right.\n",

    "   - Correlation coefficient (r) ranges from -1 to 1. A correlation of 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, and 0 indicates no linear relationship.\n",
    "   - Correlation measures not only the direction but also the strength of the relationship between variables, making it a more informative measure compared to covariance.\n",

    "1. Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "   - Mean: Outliers have a significant impact on the mean because they affect its calculation directly. A single outlier with a very high or low value can pull the mean towards it, making it unrepresentative of the majority of the data.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Measures of Dispersion:\n",
