    "The `loc` and `iloc` functions in pandas.DataFrame are used for accessing data in a DataFrame, but they have different ways of indexing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **loc**: \n",
    "   - `loc` is primarily label-based indexing, which means you use column and row labels to access data.\n",
    "   - You use the row and column labels directly to access data.\n",
    "   - It can accept boolean arrays or callable functions for filtering rows or columns.\n",
    "   - It is inclusive of the start and stop indices provided.\n",
    "   - Example: `df.loc[3, 'column_name']` or `df.loc['row_label', 'column_label']`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **iloc**:\n",
    "   - `iloc` is integer-location based indexing, which means you use integer indices to access data.\n",
    "   - You use integer indices to access data, similar to how you would index a list or array.\n",
    "   - It does not accept boolean arrays or callable functions for filtering rows or columns.\n",
    "   - It is exclusive of the stop index provided.\n",
    "   - Example: `df.iloc[3, 2]` or `df.iloc[3:6, 2:5]`\n",

    "\n",
    "In pandas, window functions refer to operations that are applied over a specified window of data points in a Series or DataFrame. These functions allow for computations that involve aggregating, transforming, or analyzing data within a defined window size or structure. Window functions are particularly useful for analyzing time series data or performing rolling calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of window functions in pandas include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Rolling Window Functions**:\n",
    "   - Rolling window functions perform calculations over a fixed-size window of consecutive data points.\n",
    "   - Examples include rolling mean, rolling sum, rolling standard deviation, etc.\n",
    "   - Rolling window functions are implemented using the `.rolling()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Expanding Window Functions**:\n",
    "   - Expanding window functions calculate statistics for all data points up to the current point.\n",
    "   - As the data grows, the window expands to include all preceding data points.\n",
    "   - Examples include cumulative sum, cumulative max, cumulative min, etc.\n",
    "   - Expanding window functions are implemented using the `.expanding()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA)**:\n",
    "   - EWMA computes a weighted average where more recent data points are given greater weight.\n",
    "   - It's useful for smoothing out noisy data and identifying trends.\n",
    "   - EWMA is implemented using the `.ewm()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Grouped Window Functions**:\n",
    "   - Grouped window functions apply operations within groups defined by one or more categorical variables.\n",
    "   - They allow for group-wise analysis and aggregation.\n",
    "   - Grouped window functions are often used in conjunction with `.groupby()` followed by specific window functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "These window functions provide powerful capabilities for time-based analysis, trend detection, and feature engineering in various domains, including finance, signal processing, and data analytics. They enable efficient calculations over structured subsets of data, offering insights into temporal patterns and trends within the data."
