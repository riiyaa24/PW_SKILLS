    "Q2. Explain the difference between traditional web hosting and cloud hosting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional web hosting and cloud hosting are two different approaches to hosting and managing websites and web applications. Here's a comparison of the key differences between them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Infrastructure**:\n",
    "   - **Traditional Web Hosting**: In traditional web hosting, websites are hosted on physical servers owned and managed by a web hosting provider. Each server typically hosts multiple websites, and resources (such as CPU, RAM, and storage) are shared among the hosted sites.\n",
    "   - **Cloud Hosting**: In cloud hosting, websites are hosted on virtual servers that run on a cloud infrastructure provided by cloud service providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Cloud hosting allows for dynamic allocation of resources and scalability based on demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Scalability**:\n",
    "   - **Traditional Web Hosting**: Scalability is limited by the capacity of the physical servers. If a website experiences a sudden increase in traffic, it may not be able to handle the load efficiently, leading to performance issues or downtime.\n",
    "   - **Cloud Hosting**: Cloud hosting offers scalability on-demand. Resources can be dynamically allocated and scaled up or down based on traffic spikes or changing requirements. This elasticity allows websites to handle fluctuations in traffic more effectively and ensures optimal performance and availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Resource Allocation**:\n",
    "   - **Traditional Web Hosting**: Resources such as CPU, RAM, and storage are fixed and allocated based on the hosting plan chosen by the website owner. Upgrading resources may require migrating to a different hosting plan or server.\n",
    "   - **Cloud Hosting**: Cloud hosting allows for flexible resource allocation and pay-as-you-go pricing models. Users can scale resources up or down as needed and pay only for the resources they use. This flexibility enables cost optimization and efficient resource utilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Reliability and Redundancy**:\n",
    "   - **Traditional Web Hosting**: Reliability depends on the stability of the physical servers and infrastructure maintained by the hosting provider. There may be a single point of failure, and redundancy options may be limited.\n",
    "   - **Cloud Hosting**: Cloud hosting offers high reliability and redundancy through distributed data centers and built-in failover mechanisms. Cloud providers offer SLAs (Service Level Agreements) guaranteeing uptime and availability, and data is often replicated across multiple geographic regions for disaster recovery purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Management and Control**:\n",
    "   - **Traditional Web Hosting**: In traditional web hosting, the hosting provider manages the infrastructure, including server maintenance, updates, and security patches. Website owners have limited control over the underlying infrastructure.\n",
    "   - **Cloud Hosting**: Cloud hosting provides more control and flexibility for users to manage their infrastructure through web-based dashboards or APIs. Users can deploy, configure, and monitor their virtual servers, networks, and storage resources, giving them greater autonomy and customization options."
