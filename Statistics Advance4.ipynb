    "Q1. What is difference between a t-test and a z-test? Provide an example scenario where you would use each type of test\n",
    "\n",
    "Both t-tests and z-tests are statistical hypothesis tests used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups or if a sample mean differs significantly from a known population mean. However, they differ in the situations where they are applicable:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **T-test**:\n",
    "   - The t-test is used when the sample size is small (typically less than 30) or when the population standard deviation is unknown.\n",
    "   - It is also used when the population follows a normal distribution or when the sample size is sufficiently large (Central Limit Theorem applies).\n",
    "   - Example scenario: Suppose you want to compare the mean scores of two groups of students (e.g., Group A and Group B) on a math test. If each group has fewer than 30 students or the population standard deviation of math scores is unknown, you would use a t-test.\n",

    "2. **Z-test**:\n",
    "   - The z-test is used when the sample size is large (typically greater than 30) and the population standard deviation is known.\n",
    "   - It assumes that the population follows a normal distribution.\n",
    "   - Example scenario: Imagine you want to test if a new drug has an effect on blood pressure. You collect blood pressure measurements from a large sample of individuals (e.g., 100 participants). If you know the population standard deviation of blood pressure, you can use a z-test to determine if there's a significant difference in blood pressure between those who took the drug and those who didn't."

    "Q2: Differentiate between one-tailed and two-tailed tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "One-tailed and two-tailed tests are two types of hypothesis tests used in statistical analysis. They differ in how they assess the significance of the relationship between variables or the difference between groups. Here's a differentiation between them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **One-tailed test**:\n",
    "   - In a one-tailed test, the hypothesis is directional, meaning it specifies the direction of the effect or difference between groups.\n",
    "   - It is used when the researcher has a specific expectation about the direction of the relationship or difference.\n",
    "   - The critical region for the test is located entirely in one tail of the probability distribution.\n",
    "   - Example: Suppose a researcher wants to test if a new teaching method improves test scores compared to the old method. The null hypothesis (H0) would be that there is no difference or that the new method is worse. The alternative hypothesis (H1) would be that the new method is better. This is a one-tailed test because it only considers the possibility of improvement with the new method.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Two-tailed test**:\n",
    "   - In a two-tailed test, the hypothesis is non-directional, meaning it does not specify the direction of the effect or difference between groups.\n",
    "   - It is used when the researcher is interested in whether there is a significant difference between groups but does not have a specific expectation about the direction of the difference.\n",
    "   - The critical region for the test is divided between both tails of the probability distribution.\n",
    "   - Example: Consider a study examining whether there is a difference in reaction times between two groups of participants. The null hypothesis (H0) would be that there is no difference in reaction times between the groups. The alternative hypothesis (H1) would be that there is a difference, without specifying whether one group is faster or slower. This is a two-tailed test because it considers the possibility of a difference in either direction."

    "Q3: Explain the concept of Type 1 and Type 2 errors in hypothesis testing. Provide an example scenario for each type of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "In hypothesis testing, Type I and Type II errors represent two different ways in which the conclusions drawn from the test can be incorrect:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Type I Error**:\n",
    "   - Type I error occurs when the null hypothesis (H0) is incorrectly rejected when it is actually true. In other words, it is a false positive.\n",
    "   - The significance level (alpha, usually denoted as α) of the test determines the probability of making a Type I error. A lower significance level reduces the likelihood of a Type I error but increases the chance of a Type II error.\n",
    "   - Example scenario: Suppose a medical researcher is testing a new drug to determine if it's effective in treating a certain disease. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the drug has no effect, i.e., it is no better than a placebo. If the researcher observes a statistically significant difference in the treatment group compared to the control group and rejects the null hypothesis, but in reality, the drug does not have any effect (H0 is true), this would be a Type I error.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Type II Error**:\n",
    "   - Type II error occurs when the null hypothesis (H0) is incorrectly not rejected when it is actually false. In other words, it is a false negative.\n",
    "   - The probability of making a Type II error is denoted by beta (β). Power (1 - β) of the test is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false.\n",
    "   - Example scenario: Continuing with the medical example, let's say the new drug actually has a beneficial effect on patients, but the researcher fails to detect this effect in the study and does not reject the null hypothesis. This would be a Type II error because the researcher incorrectly concludes that the drug is not effective when it actually is."

    "\n",
    "A confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain the true population parameter, such as a population mean or proportion, with a certain level of confidence. It quantifies the uncertainty associated with estimating a population parameter from a sample.\n",
