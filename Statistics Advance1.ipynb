    "Q1. What is the Probability density function?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Probability Density Function (PDF) is a concept used in probability theory and statistics to describe the likelihood of a continuous random variable taking on a particular value within a given range. It is denoted as \\( f(x) \\), where \\( x \\) represents the possible values of the random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a continuous random variable, the probability of it taking on any specific value is typically zero because there are infinitely many possible values within any given range. Instead, the PDF describes the relative likelihood of the random variable falling within a particular interval. Mathematically, it is defined such that the area under the curve of the PDF over any interval gives the probability that the random variable falls within that interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "The properties of a PDF are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The PDF is non-negative for all values of \\( x \\).\n",
    "2. The total area under the curve of the PDF is equal to 1, representing the total probability space.\n",
    "3. The probability of the random variable falling within a specific interval is given by the integral of the PDF over that interval."

    "Q2. What are the types of Probability distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of probability distributions, each with its own characteristics and applications. Some of the most commonly encountered ones include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Uniform Distribution**: In a uniform distribution, all outcomes are equally likely. It's often represented by a horizontal line because each outcome has the same probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution)**: The normal distribution is characterized by a bell-shaped curve and is symmetrical around its mean. Many natural phenomena follow this distribution, making it one of the most widely used distributions in statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Binomial Distribution**: The binomial distribution describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials, where each trial has two possible outcomes (usually labeled as success and failure) and the probability of success is constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Poisson Distribution**: The Poisson distribution models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, given a known average rate of occurrence and assuming that events happen independently of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Exponential Distribution**: The exponential distribution describes the time between events in a Poisson process, where events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Geometric Distribution**: The geometric distribution models the number of trials needed to achieve the first success in a series of independent Bernoulli trials, where each trial has two possible outcomes (usually labeled as success and failure) and the probability of success is constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Gamma Distribution**: The gamma distribution is a generalization of the exponential distribution and describes the waiting time until the \\( k \\)-th arrival in a Poisson process with rate parameter \\( \\lambda \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Beta Distribution**: The beta distribution is a continuous probability distribution defined on the interval [0, 1]. It is often used to model proportions or probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Chi-Square Distribution**: The chi-square distribution is the distribution of the sum of the squares of independent standard normal random variables and is widely used in hypothesis testing and confidence interval construction."

    "**3. Type of Outcomes:**\n",
    "   - **Binomial Distribution**: Deals with discrete outcomes (0, 1, 2, ..., \\( n \\) successes).\n",
