    "Q1. \n",
    "a database is a structured collection of data that is organized in a way that allows it to be easily accessed, managed and updated. It serves as a centralized repository for storing and retrieving information efficiently. Databases are used in various applications ranging from simple address books to complex enterprise systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL and NoSQL are two broad categories of database management systems that differ in their data models, query languages, scalability and use cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. SQL Databases:\n",
    "relational databases that organize data into tables with rows and columns.\n",
    "follow ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties to ensure data integrity.\n",
    "Use SQL for querying and manipulating data\n",
    "examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle SQL, SQL Server, SQLite. \n",
    "best suited for applications requiring complex queries, transactions, and structured data schemas. \n",
    "2. NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "non-relational databases that store data in flexible, schema-less formats such as key-value pairs, documents, wide-column stores or graphs\n",
    "designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data\n",
    "support eventual consistency rather than strict consistency guarantees.\n",
    "offer high scalability and performace of distributed environments\n",
    "examples include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Counchbase \n",
    "ideal for applications with rapidly evolving requirements, big data, real-time analytics and distributed systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, SQL Databases excel in handling structured data with complex relationships and transactions, while NoSQL databases are preferred for their flexibility, scalability and ability to handle unstructured or semi-structured data in distributed environments. the choice between SQL and NoSQL depends on the specific requirements and characteristics of the application.

    "Q2. DDL stands for Data Definition Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to define the structure and organization of databases and database objects. DDL commands are responsible for creating, modifying, and deleting database objects such as tables, indexes, views, and constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an explanation of commonly used DDL commands with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CREATE:\n",
    "   - CREATE command is used to create new database objects such as tables, indexes, views, or schemas.\n",
    "   - Example: Creating a new table named \"Employees\" with columns for employee ID, name, and department:\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     CREATE TABLE Employees (\n",
    "         EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",

    "     );\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. DROP:\n",
    "   - DROP command is used to delete existing database objects such as tables, indexes, views, or schemas.\n",
    "   - Example: Dropping the previously created \"Employees\" table:\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     DROP TABLE Employees;\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ALTER:\n",
    "   - ALTER command is used to modify the structure of existing database objects, such as adding, modifying, or dropping columns.\n",
    "   - Example: Adding a new column named \"Salary\" to the \"Employees\" table:\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     ALTER TABLE Employees\n",
    "     ADD Salary DECIMAL(10, 2);\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. TRUNCATE:\n",
    "   - TRUNCATE command is used to remove all rows from a table, but it retains the table structure and metadata.\n",
    "   - Example: Truncating data from the \"Employees\" table:\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;\n",
    "     ```\n",

    "Here's an explanation of commonly used DML commands with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. INSERT:\n",

    "\n",

    "Q5. Primary Key:\n",
    "A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a relational database table that uniquely identifies each row in the table. It serves as a unique identifier for the records in the table and ensures data integrity by preventing duplicate or null values in the key columns. A primary key constraint is applied to the column(s) designated as the primary key, ensuring that they are unique and not null.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics of a primary key:\n",
    "1. Uniqueness: Each value in the primary key column(s) must be unique, meaning no two rows can have the same value in the primary key column(s).\n",
    "2. Non-null: The primary key column(s) cannot contain null values, ensuring that every row in the table is uniquely identifiable.\n",
    "3. Immutable: Primary key values should not change once they are assigned to a row. This ensures consistency and integrity of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a table named \"Students\" with columns: StudentID (Primary Key), Name, Age, and Grade. The StudentID column uniquely identifies each student in the table, and it cannot contain null values or duplicate entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign Key:\n",
    "A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a relational database table that establishes a relationship between two tables. It creates a link between the data in two tables by referencing the primary key of another table. The foreign key column(s) in one table refer to the primary key column(s) in another table, defining a parent-child relationship between the tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics of a foreign key:\n",
    "1. Referential integrity: Foreign keys maintain referential integrity between related tables by ensuring that values in the foreign key column(s) correspond to existing values in the primary key column(s) of the referenced table.\n",
    "2. Relationship: A foreign key establishes a relationship between the referencing table (child table) and the referenced table (parent table), typically representing a one-to-many or many-to-one relationship.\n",
    "3. Optional: Foreign keys can be nullable, allowing some rows in the referencing table to have null values in the foreign key column(s). This indicates that there may not be a corresponding entry in the referenced table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider two tables, \"Students\" and \"Courses,\" where \"Students\" has a primary key StudentID, and \"Courses\" has a primary key CourseID. To establish a relationship between these tables, the \"Courses\" table can include a foreign key column, such as StudentID, referencing the StudentID column in the \"Students\" table. This foreign key column in the \"Courses\" table indicates which student is enrolled in each course, creating a relationship between the two tables."

    "- If the query modifies data (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), it will be executed directly on the database.\n",
    "- For SELECT queries, the `execute()` method just sends the query to the database without fetching any data. Data fetching is done separately using methods like `fetchall()`, `fetchone()`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, the `cursor.execute()` method is used to execute the SQL query `\"SELECT * FROM your_table\"`. The results are then fetched using the `fetchall()` method and displayed. Finally, the cursor and connection are closed to release resources."

    "1. **FROM**: The FROM clause specifies the table(s) from which the data will be retrieved.\n",

    "2. **WHERE**: The WHERE clause is used to filter rows from the tables specified in the FROM clause based on specific conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **GROUP BY**: The GROUP BY clause is used to group rows that have the same values into summary rows, typically for use with aggregate functions like SUM, COUNT, AVG, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **HAVING**: The HAVING clause is used in combination with the GROUP BY clause to filter groups based on specific conditions, similar to the WHERE clause but applied to grouped rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **SELECT**: The SELECT clause specifies the columns that will be returned in the query result. This clause can also include aggregate functions for summarizing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **DISTINCT**: The DISTINCT keyword is used to eliminate duplicate rows from the query result.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **ORDER BY**: The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the rows in the query result based on specified columns, either in ascending or descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **LIMIT / OFFSET**: The LIMIT and OFFSET clauses are used to limit the number of rows returned by the query and to skip a specified number of rows, respectively. These are often used for pagination purposes."
