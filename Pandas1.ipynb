    "\n",
    "In Pandas, a DataFrame is a two-dimensional labeled data structure capable of holding data of different types (e.g., integers, floats, strings, etc.) in columns. It is similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table, where data is organized into rows and columns. Each column in a DataFrame can be of a different data type. DataFrames allow for various operations such as data manipulation, filtering, merging, and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a Pandas Series is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding data of a single data type (e.g., integers, floats, strings, etc.). A Series is essentially a single column of data with associated row labels or indices. Series are similar to Python lists but with additional functionality and flexibility.\n",

    "Q5. What are some common functions you can use to manipulate data in a Pandas DataFrame? Can you give an example of when you might use one of these functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous functions available in Pandas for manipulating data in a DataFrame. Some common functions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `head()` and `tail()`: These functions allow you to view the first or last few rows of a DataFrame, respectively. They are useful for quickly inspecting the structure of your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `info()`: This function provides a concise summary of the DataFrame including the data types of each column and information about missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `describe()`: This function generates descriptive statistics for numeric columns in the DataFrame such as count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `drop()`: This function allows you to drop rows or columns from the DataFrame based on labels or indices. It's useful for removing unnecessary data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `fillna()`: This function allows you to fill missing values in the DataFrame with specified values or methods such as mean, median, or mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `groupby()`: This function is used to group data in the DataFrame based on one or more columns and perform aggregate functions such as sum, mean, count, etc. It's useful for data analysis and summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `merge()` and `concat()`: These functions are used to combine multiple DataFrames either by merging on common columns or concatenating along rows or columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. `apply()`: This function applies a function along an axis of the DataFrame. It's useful for applying custom functions to each row or column.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. `sort_values()`: This function sorts the DataFrame by the values of one or more columns. It's useful for arranging data in ascending or descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. `pivot_table()`: This function creates a spreadsheet-style pivot table from the DataFrame. It's useful for reshaping and summarizing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Suppose you have a DataFrame containing sales data with a 'Product' column and a 'Sales' column. You want to calculate the total sales for each product. You can use the `groupby()` function to group the data by 'Product' and then apply the `sum()` function to calculate the total sales for each product.\n",

    "import pandas as pd\n",

    "df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Group by 'Product' and calculate total sales for each product\n",

    "print(total_sales)\n",

    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Product\n",
    "A    300\n",
    "B    330\n",
    "C    210\n",
    "Name: Sales, dtype: int64\n",
